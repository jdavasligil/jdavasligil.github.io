### The Game

{: style="text-align: justify" }
[Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a creative playground where the content is created by the players. I have always enjoyed exploring other creators' custom maps which you can find on the Steam Workshop. I decided to recreate the world famous [Tempest Freerunning Academy](https://www.tempestacademy.com/valley){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} because I was enamoured with the world of parkour.


### The Work

{: style="text-align: justify" }
The amount of work required was daunting, but in 2014 I decided to try my hand at creating my own map. I learned how to use the Source SDK which comes with the Hammer 3d editor. I learned how to create custom textures with the [Valve Texture Format](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Texture_Format){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} including bump maps and reflectivity values for rendering realistic surfaces. I used my skills as a graphic designer to recreate the wonderful artwork in game. I read civil engineering documents to get the dimensions of features like stairs, doors and parking spaces just right. I spent the entire year from January until December learning everything I needed to make my vision a reality. Diving right into the deep end of a massive project and seeing it through to the end has been one of the highlights of my life.


### Why I Stopped

{: style="text-align: justify" }
My decision to pursue Mathematics in university put a hold on my map creation ambitions. However, I am still in love with the art form, and I still follow other map creators like [UEAKCrash](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQau-O2C0kGJpR3_CHBTGbw){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} whose work I greatly admire.

### The Success

{: style="text-align: justify" }
gm_TempestAcademy has 15,818 workshop subscribers as of today (11/17/2020) and has been showcased by popular youtubers in videos exceeding [17 MILLION views (nswf - language)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jha1vy4txxs){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}! I am astounded with how popular my first custom map became, and slightly embarassed due to some amateur mistakes. But I am proud of this achievement because I poured my soul into making every detail of it.
