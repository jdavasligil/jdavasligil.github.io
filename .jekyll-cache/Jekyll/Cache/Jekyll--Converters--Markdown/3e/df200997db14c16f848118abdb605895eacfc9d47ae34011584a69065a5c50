<h3 id="hacker-research-scholarship">Hacker Research Scholarship</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.math.wsu.edu/scholarships/HackerScholarship2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research scholarship</a> was my second undergraduate research opportunity at Washington State University. Dr. Asaki was curious about the properties of an algorithm they came up with at Los Alamos to improve image recovery. I was able to prove that it satisfied certain properties which classified it as a special case of a well understood algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="valuable-experiences">Valuable Experiences</h3>

<p>I was required to submit a formal research proposal and curriculum vitae (CV) to obtain approval from the department. This was a valuable experience by itself. However, the challenges involved in researching and deeply understanding the problem whilst taking five upper division classes (including two graduate courses) was immense.</p>

<h3 id="poster-design">Poster Design</h3>

<p>The final product of this research was to be a professional conference poster. I considered many options for making the poster, but settled on making it from scratch with vector graphics. I did not like any of the pre-made designs or programs. I used LaTeX to create the beautiful mathematics, Python with Matplotlib for the graphics, and Inkscape for the overall design. This workflow proved to be both efficient and effective; the result speaks for itself!</p>
