<h3 id="the-game">The Game</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garryâ€™s Mod</a> is a creative playground where the content is created by the players. I have always enjoyed exploring other creatorsâ€™ custom maps which you can find on the Steam Workshop. I decided to recreate the world famous <a href="https://www.tempestacademy.com/valley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tempest Freerunning Academy</a> because I was enamoured with the world of parkour.</p>

<h3 id="the-work">The Work</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">The amount of work required was daunting, but in 2014 I decided to try my hand at creating my own map. I learned how to use the Source SDK which comes with the Hammer 3d editor. I learned how to create custom textures with the <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Texture_Format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valve Texture Format</a> including bump maps and reflectivity values for rendering realistic surfaces. I used my skills as a graphic designer to recreate the wonderful artwork in game. I read civil engineering documents to get the dimensions of features like stairs, doors and parking spaces just right. I spent the entire year from January until December learning everything I needed to make my vision a reality. Diving right into the deep end of a massive project and seeing it through to the end has been one of the highlights of my life.</p>

<h3 id="why-i-stopped">Why I Stopped</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">My decision to pursue Mathematics in university put a hold on my map creation ambitions. However, I am still in love with the art form, and I still follow other map creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQau-O2C0kGJpR3_CHBTGbw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UEAKCrash</a> whose work I greatly admire.</p>

<h3 id="the-success">The Success</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">gm_TempestAcademy has 15,818 workshop subscribers as of today (11/17/2020) and has been showcased by popular youtubers in videos exceeding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jha1vy4txxs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 MILLION views (nswf - language)</a>! I am astounded with how popular my first custom map became, and slightly embarassed due to some amateur mistakes. But I am proud of this achievement because I poured my soul into making every detail of it.</p>
